# ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Data Storage Limitation

## üö® Critical Information for Client

### **Current Data Storage**
- All project data is stored in **browser localStorage**
- Data is **NOT backed up to a server**
- Data is **device-specific** (won't sync between computers)

### **Risk Factors**
- **Browser cache cleared** = All data lost
- **Different computer** = No access to data
- **Browser update issues** = Potential data loss
- **Incognito/Private mode** = Data not saved

### **Recommendations**
1. **Regular Backups**: Export project data regularly
2. **Single Device**: Use one primary computer for admin
3. **Browser Consistency**: Always use the same browser
4. **Future Upgrade**: Consider server-based storage for production use

### **Backup Strategy**
- Take screenshots of important projects
- Keep project images in a separate folder
- Document project details externally
- Consider periodic manual backups

### **What This Means**
- **Suitable for**: Initial use, small teams, single-user management
- **Not suitable for**: Multi-user access, critical data, long-term storage
- **Upgrade path**: Server-based database for production use

## üîÑ Future Improvements

For long-term production use, consider upgrading to:
- **Database storage** (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- **Cloud storage** (AWS, Google Cloud)
- **User authentication** system
- **Multi-user access** controls
- **Automated backups**

This current system is designed for initial deployment and testing. For production use with multiple users or critical data, a server-based solution is recommended.
